= What does the AutoPoly - AI Translation For Polylang plugin do? =
This plugin automatically copies and translates your posts, including titles, content, images, galleries, and meta fields, from one language to another using Chrome AI. It works with Elementor and Gutenberg blocks, replicating the original content and styles across different languages.

= Is this plugin officially developed by Polylang? =
No, this plugin is not developed by or affiliated with the Polylang developers. It is a third-party addon designed to extend Polylang's functionality by adding automatic translation capabilities.

= Do I need an API key to use this plugin? =
No, this plugin does not require an API key. It uses Chrome built-in AI to provide automatic translations.

= Can I use this plugin with custom blocks or themes? =
This plugin works with Gutenberg blocks and several popular third-party blocks (e.g., Spectra, Kadence, Stackable, Otter, and Essential). While it may work with custom blocks or themes, compatibility is not guaranteed, so we recommend doing testing.

= Does the plugin translate all content on my website? =
The plugin automatically translates the entire content within your Elementor widgets and Gutenberg blocks. It does not translate content outside of these blocks or widgets, such as custom widgets, shortcodes, or other plugins' content that doesn't utilize Gutenberg blocks or Elementor widgets.

= Does this plugin support page & post sync for translations? =
Currently, our plugin does not support automatic synchronization of pages and posts across multiple languages. This means updates made to the original content will not automatically appear in the translated versions.

However, you can manually copy the original content into the translated page, and then use our inline translation feature to translate that content.

We’re considering adding sync support in future updates based on user feedback.

= How do I manage the translated content? =
The translated content is managed within the WordPress editor, just like your original content. The plugin duplicates your content into other languages, which you can then later review and adjust as needed.

= Can I undo the automatic translations if needed? =
Yes, you can manually edit or remove the translated content in the WordPress editor after it has been automatically translated.

= Which editors and page builders are supported? =

AutoPoly fully supports Gutenberg blocks, Elementor pages, and several popular third-party block libraries such as Spectra, Kadence Blocks, Otter Blocks, Stackable, and Essential Blocks.
The pro version of this addon supports the Classic Editor, allowing translation of standard content created without blocks.

= What if the translation quality is not accurate? =
While the plugin uses Chrome AI for automatic translations, you can manually adjust the translated content within the WordPress editor to ensure accuracy.

= Can I translate all posts and pages in bulk? =

Yes! The pro version of the plugin includes a Bulk Translate feature that lets you automatically duplicate and translate multiple posts, pages, or custom post types in one click. Simply select the source language and target languages, and the plugin will process them all at once

= How do I update the plugin to the latest version? =
You can update the plugin through the WordPress dashboard like any other plugin. Regular updates will ensure you have the latest features and security improvements.

= Will this plugin slow down my website? =
The plugin is optimized for performance, but the speed impact may vary depending on your hosting environment and the size of your content. The automatic translation process occurs in the background to minimize any potential impact on site performance.

= Does this plugin support the Classic Editor? =
Currently, this plugin does not support automatic translations for content created with the Classic Editor. It is designed to work with Elementor and Gutenberg blocks only.

= How can I report security bugs? =
